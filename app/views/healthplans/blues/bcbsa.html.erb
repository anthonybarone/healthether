History:
Blue Cross (Facility)
1929: Baylor Hospital was on the verge of bankruptcy.  Justin Kimball, Superintendin of the Dallas public school system devised a product for 50 cents to have 21 days of inpatient services that teachers would get.  It was a payment innovation and reform to save the local hospital system.

1933: 16 Health Plans with 35,000 members.

BlueCross BlueShield Association (BCBSA):

2013: 37 BCBS independent licensees across the United States.
2013: National Examples: Aetna, CIGNA and United are the big brand competitors to Blues.  Regional Example: Kaiser is a regional plan only known in California.  Conventry, HealthNet and Humana are other regional examples. Local Example: Intermountain Health Care is owned by the Mormans who own hospitals, doctors and an insurance product.
2013: Kids today are not loyal to the BCBS brand as their grandparents and parents were previously.
2013: 100 million or every 1 in 3 Americans carry BCBS healthcare insurance coverage.  1/3 of facility and profressional revenue / accounts receivable are from Blues plans.  United is at 40 million, Aetna 22 million, CIGNA 13 million.

2013: national account enrollment is 26 million or 26%.
2013: 298 fortune 500 companies have BCBS.
2013: < 1000 members, market share is the strongest due to ASO and the admin cost structure to support interplan fees relative to the Nationals systems and economies of scale.
2013: Typically do better in labor and union contracts.
2013: Plans Operating in Multiple States:  Wellpoint (14 states - Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York - Empire, Ohio, Virginia, California, Georgia, Missouri - St. Louis, Wisconsin), CareFirst (2 states - Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia), HCSC (5 States - Illinois, Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Montana), BCBS Tenessee (2 states - Tennessee, Georgia), BCBS of Kansas City (2 states - Missouri - Kansas City, Kansas), Highmark (4 states - Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Deleware), Premera (2 states - Alaska, Washington), Cambia Health Solutions (2 states - Idaho, Washington - 2 counties), Wellmark (2 states - Iowa, South Dakota)

2013: Two investor owned for-profit Blue Plans: Wellpoint Triple-S Management Corp (Puerto Rico)
2013: Would be a fortune 4 company if all 37 licensees were combined.
2013: 90% of all hospitals contract with their local Blue.  The discounts to members are actually greater than they payment to providers.  Blues are paying facilities less than they are giving us in a discount.  Therefore, must provide impeccable service to our business partners.
2013: 85% of all professionals contract their local Blue. Blues are paying professional providers less than they are giving us in a discount.  Therefore, must provide impeccable service to our business partners.

BlueCard 2014 Priorities Continuing from 2013
1. Networks, Care Management Enhancement & Payment Innovations (Payment Innovations - perhaps the biggest change to pay attention to from an ITS perspecitve - complex and challenging), Electronic Provider Access (EPA), Blue Distinction)
2. Exchange Business (Risk Adjustment, BlueCard for Exchanges)
3. Consumer Engagement (National Consumer Cost Tool, Member Out-of-Pocket, Patient Review, Transparency / Consuemr Operations)
4. Operational Excellence & Improve Service Performance (Performance Reporting, Data Management, Network Reporting Automation, Claims Administration)
5. Regulatory Compliance (Health Information Technology, Administration Simplification, ICD-10)

In 2014, BlueCard will also support the new Board strategic priorities including:
New Strategic Priorities:
1. Inter-Plan Programs Policy Review
2. Transfer Program Review
3. Data as a Strategic Asset
4. Senior Markets (historically has not been )
5. Others TBD (e.g. Private Exchanges - not a federal or state exchange.  Someone like Aeon that facilitates an employer to subsidize a portion of employees healthcare and then chooses from a list of plans to choose from e.g. Walgreens and other employers have chosen to go in this direction).  EXCHANGE STRATEGY IS HUGE!!!  Federal, State and Private.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Inter-plan performance Scorecard is in the 40s out of 100 - very low & at risk as a health plan.  ClaimCheck update affected an entire Interplan Performance Scorecard.  Carol Bump stated a ClaimCheck issue caused us getting to where we are with very low scores due to a provider implementation.  Set up a meeting to educate Bill, Susann and I to make this statement in front of the entire audience.  Not sure anything a claims processer could have done to change this issue.  It was a programatic issue that was made.
