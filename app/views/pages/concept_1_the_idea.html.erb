<p>Healthether is a healthcare platform created to promote awareness, discussion and learning through creative innovative content.  The platform brings to light the current reality of the whole healthcare system. Once current reality is better understood, it can then be questioned. New visions can then be formed.

The healthether community is full of nice people who want to learn from others and help others learn.  Become part of the family and give something back when you can.
