To keep it simple, Healthether classifies healthcare into three product types designed and developed by those at risk for medical costs â€“ governments, health insurers and self-funded programs. Medicaid (low-income and military government financed), Medicare (elderly & disabled government financed) and Commercial Health Insurance (entry level, middle & upscale privately financed healthcare). There is an alphabet soup of product names and types that can make things confusing quickly. Stick with these three product types to keep a frame of reference to understand the primary populations and markets.
NOTE: In all government entitlement programs, the risk for medical expenses is borne by state and/or federal government agencies and , ultimately, the taxpayers.

In comparison, housing can be classified by low-income, elderly & disabled and commercial (entry level, middle & upscale housing).
